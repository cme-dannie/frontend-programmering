      /* We create a promise with a passed anonymous function. This function
      STILL serves no purpose that makes any sort of sense, but we will understand 
      how it fits into the bigger picture soon.
      
      Let's take note of the fact that our executor function is executed immediately.
      
      The Promise executor function is also sometimes called the "Promise body", because it
      contains the body of the promise itself, much like <body> in HTML contains the content 
      of a web page. */
