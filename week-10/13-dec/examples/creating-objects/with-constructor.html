      since we wish to treat this function as a constructor.

      Worth noting is:
      1. The 'this' keyword can now be utilized to refer to the object
      which is currently being created. This is directly connected
      with the 'new' keyword which is being used further down.
      2. The object that is being constructed is returned implicitly,
      even WITHOUT a 'return' statement! */

      /* This is identical to what we did with Object.create to add
      a custom prototype. Without doing this, we will NOT have access
      to 'makeNoise' and 'eat' for our animal objects.

      Worth noting here is that 'prototype' is a property which exists on ALL
      functions. This is key, since we need this in order to set our custom
      prototype.
      
      This property says:
      - All objects that are created with this constructor will inherit from
      this prototype object. In our case they will inherit from 'animalPrototype',
      just like before.
      
      This is the "constructor variant" of using Object.create(animalPrototype).
      
      Without doing this, all our objects created with this constructor will inherit
      from the default object prototype, which has 'toString', 'hasOwnProperty' etc. */
      Animal.prototype = animalPrototype;

      /* Notice how we use the new keyword to create new animals.

      In programming we usually phrase this as "instantiating objects"
      of a particular type or class.

      We "instantiate three animals of the type/class Animal".

      We will revisit the concept of a class a bit later. Right now you can
      conceptually view them as a "blueprint". The 'Animal' constructor is a
      blueprint for how to construct animals. 
      
      Much like an architectural drawing might define
      how a house is supposed to be built/constructed, our Animal constructor
      does the same for animal objects. */
