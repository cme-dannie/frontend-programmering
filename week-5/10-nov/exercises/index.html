      /*
        In the exercises of today we will make ourselves more comfortable with JS.

        What we will cover is:

        - Using comparison operators
        - Using logical operators
        - Using more arithmetic operators
        - Making decisions in our code

        Some recommendations:

        - Use the Chrome DevTools debugger when you are stuck! This is accessed
        through the "Sources" tab in DevTools
        - Use the Chrome DevTools console accessed through the "Console" tab
        - Use the waiting list if you need help: https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/
