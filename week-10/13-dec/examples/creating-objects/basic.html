      const animal = {

      const otherAnimal = {
        name: "Peanut",
        type: "Kind",

        name: "Bubba",

      /* Notice how this approach becomes less sustainable the more animals
      we wish to create. 
      
      This is not applicable to only animals, but rather
      any number of similar objects you wish to create in your program. 
      
      Other examples could be: 
      - 'players' with properties such as 'name' and 'score'
      - 'users' with properties such as 'username' and 'password'
      - 'list items' with properties such as 'title' and 'isBold'
      - 'bookmarks' with properties such as 'name' and 'isFavourite'
      - 'actions' with properties such as 'isDone' and 'doneBy',
      - 'emails' with properties such as 'subject' and 'message'
      
      It all depends on what your program needs. Objects are very powerful
      constructs, and we will continue to see examples on how we can work with
      them. 
      
      Soon enough we will tie this back into the prototype chain. */
