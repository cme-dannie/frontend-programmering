      /* In the exercises of today we will make ourselves comfortable with some
        basics of JS. These are:

        - Creating/declaring variables
        - Working with primitive data types
        - Assigning values to variables
        - Printing values to the console
        - Making basic calculations on these values

        Open this website in Chrome and make sure you have the DevTools Console open.

        We have previously used the "Elements" tab in DevTools. We need to use the second one
        called "Console". */

      /* 1. Create two variables meant to represent a first and a lastname. */

      /* 2. Log these two variables to the console. Open Chrome DevTools and notice
        the values that is printed. Try to see if you can log them both on one line */

      /* 3. Assign these variables a String value based on your own name */

      /* 4. Now log them again, on separate lines */

      /* 5. Create a new variable called "fullName" which represents the values
      of both the previous variables, with a space between. For me that
      would become "Dannie HÃ¥kansson". */

      /* 6. Log this new variable representing your full name */

      /* 7. Create a new variable representing the amount of income tax we pay
      in Sweden. The value we should give our variable is value
      is (give or take) 0.3. Notice how we're able to store not only integer values,
      but also decimal numbers. 
      This all works inside of our datatype called "Number". */

      /* 8. Now create another variable representing an income before tax has been
      deducted (gross salary or bruttolÃ¶n). */

      /* 9. We now wish to log the value of the calculated income tax to the
      console. (30% of our gross income). Do this with our existing variables */

      /* 10. Create three variables representing three different 
      employee gross salaries. Assign a different value for each of them. */

      /* 11. Now we want to calculate the average gross salary for the company.
      Log this to the console. 
      
      This might be a bit tricky because you will have 
      to use a parenthesis wrapping the addition of the three salaries. 
      This is because division takes precedence over addition in JS.*/

      /* 12. Create a variable representing a user that is currently
      logged in. Assign this variable a boolean value of choice. 
      Log this to the console */

      /* On wednesday we will continue elaborating on JS and how we can make
      evaluations/calculations. Stay tuned ðŸ¤“ */
