      /*
        Let's build Rock Paper Scissors. The game will be played against a
        computer.

        - The computer choice will be randomized.
        - The player choice will be 1, 2 or 3. These represent Rock, Paper and
        Scissors.
        - After each player choice, a message will be shown telling the player
        if he/she won against the computer choice.
        - The game ends when either the computer or the player reaches 5
        total wins.
        - We should probably show the score of each player each time a prompt
        is shown.
