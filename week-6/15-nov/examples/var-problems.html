      /* Problem 1: Access without having even declared the variable.
      
      This is what we call variable hoisting. This is actually really peculiar.
      
      We will not dive further into this topic because it can go really deep, but
      this confusing behaviour has caused lots of errors in JS programs. Why?
      Because a programmer wrote some code that accessed a variable before it was even
      declared and given a value. */
      console.log(test);
      var test = "Dannie";

      /* Problem 2: Declaring a variable with the same name is perfectly fine. This is
      also a root cause for lots of errors in programs. It basically "shadows" our 
      first variable declaration, rendering it completely useless. This is a case of JS 
      allowing the programmer to do things that is definitely not intended. 
      Quite frankly, this behaviour is really stupid. */
      var number = 1;
      console.log(number);
      var number = 10;
      console.log(number);

      /* Problem 3: In lots of programming languages, it's common to express a value
      that never changes. We call this a constant. This is not possible with var,
      making it yet again hard to make sure your program is correctly written. */
      var myConstant = "DON'T CHANGE ME";
      console.log(myConstant);
      myConstant = "Well, I had no idea that you didn't want to change...";
      console.log(myConstant);

      /* All of these problems can be alleviated with that we will now learn */
