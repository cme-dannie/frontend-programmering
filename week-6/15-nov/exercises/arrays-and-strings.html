    <title>Array and string exercises</title>
    <script>
      /* 
        Here we will make ourselves comfortable with using lists/arrays as well
        as Strings. Needless to say, this is a very common thing in programming, 
        and something you will need to make yourselves comfortable with.
        
        Arrays are a very powerful data structure that you will use very much
        in the programs that you write. These exercises will prove the flexibility 
        of them very much.

        I recognize that these exercises will be harder than the previous ones
        that you have done. Be humble with regard to that fact. 

        NOTE: Some solutions require searching by your own for solutions that are
        not immediately in front of you. Just like we have covered:

        - length
        - push

        There are many other things to do with an array.

        NOTE: Try to use template literal strings to make dynamic string building
        easier. Also, please create functions if you feel the need. They help
        clarify the code :)

        NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck. This CANNOT
        be overstated.
        
        NOTE: Use https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/ when you need help 💪.

        Good luck!

      /* 1. We have a big class of students! Can you figure out how to print them 
      all on individual lines? Add a 👋 to the end of every print, 
      to simulate everyone saying hi :). "Dannie Håkansson 👋" is an example, if
      I were to be a student in your class. */

      /* 2. We now want to sort every student in alphabetical order. Can you
      figure out how to do that? When you do, print that result to the console. */

      /* 3. We now want to create a new list containing only the student 
      first names. Print this to the console. */

      /* 4. The students have varying amounts of names. Can you make individual 
      prints that render like "Hi I'm <firstName> and I have <number> names"? */

      /* 5. Can you build a string consisting of every student with the word 'and'
      separating them all? Print this to the console. */

      /* 6. Can you replace every occurrence of a blankspace " " within each student
      with an emoji like 👀? Put this result in a new list as to not
      affect our original one :)
      
      Example: "Dannie Håkansson" should become "Dannie👀Håkansson". */

      /* BONUS 1. We now want to know the number of occurrences of the character 'm'
      amongst all of our students full names. Can you calculate and print that
      to the console? For only "Dannie Håkansson" the amount is 1.
      
      The final count should add up to 19. */

      /* BONUS 2. It can sometimes be hard to help every student at once. It can then 
      be good to make the total group smaller. Can you make four lists that are 
      evenly sized, based on the original students list? The result should be that 
      we have 10 in each list. Print these to the console like:

      "This is group <number>: <groupList>".
      
      A hint is that this concept is called "chunking" the array, or "creating
      chunks".
      
      Another hint is that it's possible to have an array with arrays :)
      
      A last hint is that 'slice' is a useful function :) */

      /* BONUS 3. Can you print a new name for every student, which omits the first
      and last characters of every name they have?
      
      For "Dannie Håkansson" that would become "anni åkansso".
      
      A hint is that it's possible to have nested loops ;) */

      /* If you've managed to solve all of the above exercises, then I applaud you.
      You're really starting to learn how to program!

      If you're not quite there yet, don't worry. It takes TIME to get used to the
      mindset of solving problems like this 🤓 */
