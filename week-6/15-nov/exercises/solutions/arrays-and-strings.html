    <title>Array and string exercises</title>
    <script>
      /*
        Here we will make ourselves comfortable with using lists/arrays as well
        as Strings. Needless to say, this is a very common thing in programming,
        and something you will need to make yourselves comfortable with.

        Arrays are a very powerful data structure that you will use very much
        in the programs that you write. These exercises will prove the flexibility
        of them very much.

        I recognize that these exercises will be harder than the previous ones
        that you have done. Be humble with regard to that fact.

        NOTE: Some solutions require searching by your own for solutions that are
        not immediately in front of you. Just like we have covered:

        - length
        - push

        There are many other things to do with an array.

        NOTE: Try to use template literal strings to make dynamic string building
        easier. Also, please create functions if you feel the need. They help
        clarify the code :)

        NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck. This CANNOT
        be overstated.

        NOTE: Use https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/ when you need help 💪.

        Good luck!
