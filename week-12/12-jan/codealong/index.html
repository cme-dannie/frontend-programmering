      /* In the codealong of today we will continue to familiarise ourselves with
        open web services.

        We will be using TWO different web services today:

        - The Covid 19 Data API found at https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data/
        - The google maps API found at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map

        The idea is that we will:
        - Build a search which will retrieve Covid data by Country name.
        - The google maps API will help us to render a map
        - We will display a map with a marker related to the location we retrieved from the Covid Data API, as well as information
        related to Covid for that region (active, confirmed, deaths etc).
        - Every time we search we might be able to scroll/pan/zoom the map that we created, to the new location.
        
        In order to use these services we need to have created an API key. One for each API. 
        
        I will do that in the beginning of this codealong, so that we won't get stuck. 

        I have used neither of these web services before, so it should be interesting to see what we'll be able
        to build together :) */
