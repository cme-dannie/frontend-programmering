      In the exercises of today we will start to make ourselves
      comfortable using the DOM.

      NOTE: Some solutions will require you to search for solutions that are not
      immediately in front of you. This will not change, as that's how you will
      have to work when you start your first job.

      NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck.
      This CANNOT be overstated.
