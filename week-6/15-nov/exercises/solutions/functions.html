      /* We will here make ourselves comfortable with using functions in
        JS. They are one of the most common structures within a program, and they
        are used to make code more readable and reusable.
        
        The exercise is based on the "guessing game" we built last week. The 
        foundation is an infinite loop that never ends. It's up to you
        to finish the program given the functions that are already there.
        
        Some of the functions below are empty, some of them are not used, and some
        of them are missing a return value. We want to "fill in the blanks" so that
        everything works as intended.
        
        NOTE: Feel free to write your own functions in addition to the ones 
        already there.

        NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck. This CANNOT
        be overstated.

        NOTE: Use https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/ when you need help ðŸ’ª.
