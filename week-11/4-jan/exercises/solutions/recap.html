      /* The exercises of today will make you comfortable with using
      callbacks, promises as well as async/await. Good luck!
      
      The code that is written is mimicing 5 tasks that
        work asynchronously. We will work through some exercises
        to get familiar with this concept. */

      /* 1. We're currently iterating all of our list items using 'forEach',
        but we're doing nothing inside of that function (notice the '???'). 
        Let's change that.

        Invoke 'setupClickListener' with the list item and a callback as 
        parameter.

        This callback represents whenever an item has been "initiated".

        Make it so that when this callback is invoked, we add a class of 
        "in-progress". Clicking the item after this change will make the 
        "crunching" visualised and animated.

      /* 2. Can you figure out how to update the text of 'status' to
      
      "Some items have been initiated" as soon as any item has been
      initiated? */

      /* 3. Can you also make the text change to 
      "Some items have been completed" as soon as at least one item has
      finished? Notice how initiating a new item after this has happened
      will re-inforce the "old" text if you're not careful. */

      /* 4. Perhaps you've noticed that it's not really clear that an item
      has been finished. Let's fix this.

      Can you figure out how to remove the class of 'in-progress' and
      instead add a class of 'complete' for each item when it is finished? 
      
      This will fix the visual inconsistencies by making it green. */

      /* 5. It's now time to refine this example with promises. Can
      you figure out how to rewrite the entire example with promises
      instead of using the existing callbacks? 
      
      This means usage of the 'Promise' constructor, 'then' and
      'resolve'. */

      /* 6. Can you figure out how to render "All items have been completed"
      in the status field when all items have been completed? 
      This will require something we haven't touched upon, 
      called 'Promise.all'. 
      
      You can read about it here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all */

      /* 7. It's now time to rewrite it with async/await :) */
