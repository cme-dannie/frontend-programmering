      /*
      In the exercises of today we will start to make ourselves
      comfortable using the DOM.

      NOTE: Some solutions will require you to search for solutions that are not
      immediately in front of you. This will not change, as that's how you will
      have to work when you start your first job.

      NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck.
      This CANNOT be overstated.

      NOTE: Use https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/ when you need help ðŸ’ª.

      /* 1. As you can see, our web page is completely empty. This is not good.
      Start of by creating a main title element that says "Hi visitor, welcome!".
      Add this to the page body. */

      /* 2. The text is quite boring when it's all black. Give it a fancy new
      color by using the 'style' attribute on your node. This attribute is how
      you access CSS properties through the DOM. Read more about it at
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style#setting_styles */

      /* 3. We now wish to wrap "welcome!" in bold through a <strong> tag. Make
      this happen. This means "Hi visitor, " will be directly in the existing
      <h1>, and "welcome!" will be in <strong>. */

      /* 4. Create a ul with 7 items representing every day of the week.
      Add the text from this array to the new items. Lastly add the list to the body. */
      const weekdays = [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday",
      ];

      /* 5. Add the existing class 'current' to the item representing today. This
      will make it green and bold */

      /* 6. Everyone dislikes sundays, right? Remove the item representing sunday,
      so that hopefully we will never see it again ðŸ˜› */

      /* 7. In order to help the visitors, we wish to have a 'title' attribute
      tooltip show up, which says "This day is <day>". For monday when hovering with
      the mouse this should say "This day is Monday". */

      /* 8. By using window.setInterval, see if you can make the 'current' class
      change to a random day every 0.5 seconds. */

      /* 9. Expand the solution to exercise 8 by adding a new window.setInterval
      which removes an item every 2 seconds. When all items are removed, see if 
      you can figure out how to turn off both of the setIntervals. Read about this
      on MDN. */
