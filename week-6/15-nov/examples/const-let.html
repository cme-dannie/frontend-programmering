      /* Solution 1: NOT having Access without having declared the variable. 
      
      This is because the declaration as well as the value assignment happens at
      the line where the instruction is written. 
      
      It's basically the opposite of "hoisting" the variable, which makes us write
      more resilient programs. */

      // console.log(number);

      /* Problem 3: In lots of programming languages, it's common to express a value
      that never changes. We call this a constant. This is not possible with var,
      making it yet again hard to make sure your program is correctly written. */
