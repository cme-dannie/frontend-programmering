/*
    Let's build Rock Paper Scissors. The game will be played against a
    computer.

    - The computer choice will be randomized.
    - The player choice will be 1, 2 or 3. These represent Rock, Paper and
    Scissors.
    - After each player choice, a message will be shown telling the player
    if he/she won against the computer choice.
    - The game ends when either the computer or the player reaches 5
    total wins.
    - We should probably show the score of each player each time a prompt
    is shown.
