      /* We're going to familiarize ourselves with a Web Service/API dedicated to POKEMON!!!.

      This might sound silly, but it's actually a really well built API.

      We're going to start small, and then try to implement more and more complexity.

      The docs can be found at https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
      
      It's quite common to dive right into unknown territory (meaning a new web service/api)
      and then discover what's possible with it. We will see how we can tackle something like this
      with our new knowledge.
      
      One thing worth doing before starting, is installing "JSON Formatter" for Chrome:
      https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa.
      
      It will make JSON print "prettier" in our browser. */
