        /* By default, all items are allowed to shrink. They will shrink as much as the can to fit onto the single row (our main axis). Notice how the number within each column "wraps" onto a new line. This is shrinking happening. The ideal size of the boxes are based on the 'flex-basis' of 'auto', which is essentially "the width of the content". It has to break the ideal size here to have them fit within the new container width (which is less than 700px).
        
        Notice that when we shrink the container too much, the content will start overflowing the flex-container itself. This is because the minimum width for flex-children is the minimum size of the content. We broke the number onto a new line, but what more can we do to shrink the item? Nothing actually. And so naturally, the content has nowhere to go, hence the overflow.

        How can we handle this overflow?
