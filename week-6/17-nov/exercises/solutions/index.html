        objects, arrays with objects as well as forEach/filter/map/reduce.

        NOTE: Some solutions require searching by your own for solutions that are
        not immediately in front of you.

        NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck. This CANNOT
        be overstated.
