      /*
      In the exercises of today we will start to make ourselves
      comfortable using the DOM, and to be more specific: how to use
      events and event listeners.

      NOTE: Some solutions will require you to search for solutions that are not
      immediately in front of you. This will not change, as that's how you will
      have to work when you start your first job.

      NOTE: When getting access to the elements within the DOM, scroll down and
      view the existing elements of <body> and see which selector would fit in
      order to retrieve them.

      NOTE: Remember that you can use named functions, anonymous functions,
      anonymous arrow functions etc. They will all be invoked when the appropriate
      event is fired, irrespective of which function you choose to create and pass
      as an event listener.

      NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck.
      This CANNOT be overstated.

      NOTE: Use https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/ when you need help üí™.

      /* 1. We have five buttons on our page. Add an event listener to them
        based on the click event, and have them say "Hi" when being clicked.
        You can do this with an alert. */

      /* 2. Expand on the previous solution by changing the alert to
      "Hi I'm <buttonText>" inside. For the first button,
        this would be "Hi I'm One". */

      /* 3. We have an input field. Input fields fire an event called "input" which
      is triggered when the content is filled in. Put the value of what the user has
      typed into our search results that currently are empty. */
      
      /* 4. Since we're now actually not really searching for ingredients, let's change
      that. Based on our 'ingredients' array below, can you print to the console all items
      that match the search query? For example, searching for 'oo' should result in 'Mushroom'
      and 'Noodles' being printed. The order doesn't matter. */
      const ingredients = [
        "Mushroom",
        "Cheese",
        "Lentils",
        "Tomato",
        "Wheat",
        "Noodles",
        "Rice",
        "Chicken",
        "Salmon",
        "Avocado",
        "Spinach",
        "Chili",
      ];

      /* 5. Let's move our console.logs to actually be items in our search results. When the search
      query changes, create a <ul> list of the relevant items from the array, and put it into
      our "results" section. */

      /* 6. Find an event which fires when a key is pressed. We want to highlight the correct
      arrow on the page based on which arrow key was pressed. Each time a new arrow key is pressed,
      we want to move the highlight to that one. I have prepared a class 'highlight' in the CSS which 
      can be utilized here. It will turn the background yellow. */

      /* BONUS: Can you figure out how to highlight the term that you've searched for, inside
      of the search result item? For instance, for 'oo' "N'oo'ddles" should be highlighted with another
      background color. For 'o', "T'o'mat'o'" should have two highlights. 
      I have prepared a class 'highlight' in the CSS which can be utilized here.

      You don't have to care about keeping the original casing, as that's quite hard to solve.
      
      A hint is that Regex and String replace are very handy tools. */
