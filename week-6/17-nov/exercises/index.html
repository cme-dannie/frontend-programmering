      /* In these exercises we will make ourselves comfortable with using
        objects, arrays with objects as well as forEach/filter/map/reduce.

        NOTE: Some solutions require searching by your own for solutions that are
        not immediately in front of you.

        NOTE: Use the DevTools Console and Debugger when you are stuck. This CANNOT
        be overstated.

        NOTE: Use https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/ when you need help ðŸ’ª.

        Good luck!

      exxercise. */

      Can you figure out how to read the value from our person based on the variable
      'key' below? This means that if 'key' changes to another property/key, the
      code should still work. Print this to the console. */

      /* 8. Below we have an array of people, consisting of our single person. Can
      you create a new object that represents you and add it to the existing 
      'people' array? A good idea is to follow the format of the existing object 
      we've been working with, but with different data. When you're done, also add 
      a third person to the list. The data representing this last person 
      can be imaginary if you'd like. */

      with a forEach loop. */

      /* 11. Create a new list representing all ages of the people. Try to do this
      by using map. */

      /* 12. Combine map with forEach to print a full name for every person. */

      /* 13. Calculate an average age across all people by using reduce */

      /* 14. Filter out all people whose first or last name doesn't include the 
      letter 'D', and make the solution case insensitive, meaning casing doesn't 
      matter. Use filter to solve this. */
