      It will contain functionality that is applicable to ALL animals.
      
      Worth noting is that we NEED to use 'this' here. Why? Well, because the
      'name', 'type' and 'noise' parameters are not accessible without it. */

        'derived' or 'inherits' from 'animalPrototype'. */

      between all of our animals. */

      object which all animals are "derived" from. This is at the core of
      why the prototype concept exists in JS. The function definitions of
      'makeNoise' and 'eat' will NOT be created for every new object, but
      rather they are already defined. 
      
      Where? On the custom prototype.
      
      In practice this is what's called "inheritance" in software. Much
      like we learnt in CSS how certain properties can be inherited,
      this means that all objects with this prototype will inherit
      'makeNoise' and 'eat'. */

      /* Worth noting is that, like in a previous example, although we have defined
      a custom prototype, this prototype actually has its own prototype, which is
      the "mother of all prototypes".
      
      animal => animalPrototype => Default prototype.
      
      We have created a chain of more than one prototype. */
