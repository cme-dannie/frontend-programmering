      /*
        1. Let the user pick rock, paper or scissors
        2. Let the computer pick as well (see if you can make this randomized somehow)
        3. Make decisions based on whether or not the user or the computer has won this round
        4. Show a current score, maybe "The score is 1 - 0".
        5. Loop the game until someone reaches 5 wins, or someone cancels
