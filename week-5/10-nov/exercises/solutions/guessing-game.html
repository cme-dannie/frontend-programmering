    <title>Exercise - Guessing game</title>
    <script>
      /*
        In this exercise we will build a small guessing game:

        Some recommendations:

        - Use the Chrome DevTools debugger when you are stuck! This is accessed
        through the "Sources" tab in DevTools
        - Use the Chrome DevTools console accessed through the "Console" tab
        - Use the waiting list if you need help: https://cme-waiting-list.netlify.app/
      */

      var validGuess = 57;
      /* 1. Prompt the user visiting this website about a number. */

      do {
        // Everything that is supposed to be repeated :)
        var input = prompt(
          "Guess a number and maybe you'll win something nice :)"
        );

        // If the user has pressed 'CANCEL'
        if (!input) {
          alert("You have canceled the game");
          break;
        }

        var parsedInput = parseInt(input);

        var isLower = parsedInput < validGuess;
        var isLowerButClose = parsedInput >= validGuess - 10;

        var isHigher = parsedInput > validGuess;
        var isHigherButClose = parsedInput <= validGuess + 20;

        var hasGuessedCorrectly = parsedInput === validGuess;

        if (isLower) {
          if (isLowerButClose) {
            alert("Your guess is low but close!");
          } else {
            alert("Your guess is too low");
          }
        } else if (isHigher) {
          if (isHigherButClose) {
            alert("Your guess is high but close!");
          } else {
            alert("Your guess is too high");
          }
        } else {
          alert("Your guess is exact");
        }
      } while (!hasGuessedCorrectly);

      /* 2. Print different things to the console depending on whether or not this
      guess is:

      - Below 'validGuess'
      - Above 'validGuess'
      - Exactly 'validGuess'

      Don't forget to convert the data before comparing :) */

      /* 3. Now we want to change our game to run as long as the user has not
      guessed exactly 'validGuess'. Add this functionality. A hint is to use a
      do-while statement (a variation of the while we've learned).
      Read about this here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while. */

      /* 4. Change the console.log statements to be 'alert' instead. This
      will help the user to see what's up ðŸ‘Œ */

      /* 5. Extend the guessing game you've written by printing different
      things (in addition to existing prints) if:

      - He/she is below but within 10 of 'validGuess'
      - He/she is above but within 20 of 'validGuess'

      These new statements can actually be written INSIDE of
      our existing statements. An if inside of an if, for example.

      The flexibility is endless ðŸ¤“ */

      /* 6. BONUS: What happens if the user presses "CANCEL" in the prompt
      window? See if you can print for the user that he/she cancelled the game
      when this happens. This should also exit the game, but the
      "you've won" print should not happen.

      Worth reading about is a new datatype called null (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null#description).
      It's similar to undefined :) */
