      Paragraphs render by default as the default font size set by the
      user/browser preferences. For Chrome that is 16px. This is the base that
      everything else is based on.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Change the default font size in Chrome to Large to see what happens to
      the text on this page. Notice it getting bigger. This is good for
      accessibility reasons. We are NOT making any assumptions as to how big the
      default font is actually rendered. Another way to see this is that we're
      respecting the default font size of the browser that the user is using.
    </p>
    <!-- 2. Activate this paragraph, which is set to a 16px font. -->
    <p class="absolute-font-size">
      I will stay 16px no matter what the browser says. I don't give a ****!
