    <title>Printing to console</title>
    <!-- We have to go to the browser console to see the output of console.log. 
        This is usually the first thing JS developers learn how to use.
    
        The name console.log comes from the fact that 
        we're "logging to the console".

        Exactly why it's written this way (why there's a dot between the words,
        as well as why it ends with a semi-colon) are things we will soon learn.
        This is all part of how the rules in JS are specified to work.

        Much like we use '<div>'' in HTML, or 'font-size' in CSS, 
        we use 'console.log' in JS. Depending on how and what we write, 
        the results will differ.

        We have now run three instructions of JS as part of a 
        website. This example is not very useful, but as you will soon learn,
        this idea of writing instructions is incredibly powerful ðŸ‘Œ
    -->
    <script>
      console.log("I'm the first instruction!");
      console.log("I'm the second instruction!");
      console.log("I'm the third and last instruction!");
    </script>
