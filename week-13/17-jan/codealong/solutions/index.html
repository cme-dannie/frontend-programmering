    What do we want do achieve today?

    - We want to build a website which lists 5 random ingredients
    for a smoothie
    - We want to use Node and NPM to "bundle" our project
    - At least one installed package
    - Project should be version controlled with git
    - Project should be hosted on GitHub for easy download/install
    - Practice of npm start/npm run build
    - Usage of a Module Bundler (snowpack)

    In what order should we do this?

    1. Build out a website which lists ingredients. We should stop
    when we face the problem of "how do we show 5 random ones".
    2. We will then introduce NPM to our project (npm init)
    3. We will then install Lodash, which is a library with
    many functions (shuffle being one of them). This will probably
    help us to show random ingredients.
    4. We will introduce Git at this point, to make the project
    version controlled.
    5. We will add a .gitignore file. Important to discuss why.
    6. We will then push our project to GitHub.
